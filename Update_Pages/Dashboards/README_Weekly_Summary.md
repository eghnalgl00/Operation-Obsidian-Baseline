# Weekly Summary Fix

This package contains the corrected `Weekly_Summary.md` for your Operation Obsidian dashboards.

## Install
1. Place `Weekly_Summary.md` inside your vault folder: `Update_Pages/`
   (replace the old version if it exists).
2. Reload Obsidian or re-open the note.

## Whatâ€™s Fixed
- Correct Dataview queries (`FROM "Daily_Logs"`) instead of broken pagePaths.
- Weekly roll-up of nodes, layers, connections, and completion flags.
- Works with your existing Daily_Log frontmatter.
